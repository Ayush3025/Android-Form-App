📱 Android Form & Local Storage Application

This project is a beginner-friendly Android application developed using Kotlin and XML that demonstrates how to build a form-based mobile app and store user data locally on the device. The goal of this app is to help students and new Android developers understand core mobile app development concepts through hands-on implementation.

The application consists of two screens (Activities).
The first screen contains a user information form where users can enter details such as Name, Email, Phone Number, and Age. It also includes Submit and Reset buttons for form handling. When the user submits the form, the data is saved locally and the app navigates to the second screen.

The second screen displays the submitted user data in a clean and centered layout, providing a simple example of passing data between activities using Intents.

To demonstrate local storage, this project uses SharedPreferences, which allows data to persist even after the app is closed or restarted. This is a common technique used in real-world Android apps for storing lightweight user information such as login details, preferences, or form responses.
